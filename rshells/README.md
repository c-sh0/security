Collection of some common and not so common reverse shell, file upload, and download tircks without the use of standard tools.

NOTES:
* Having disk write permissions on the client is +1
*  If SELinux is enabled on the client system, alot of these may not work as intended. Disable SELinux:
     
     ```[root@client]# setenforce 0```
