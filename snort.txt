Snort: https://www.snort.org/
-----------------------------------------------------
Snort is the foremost Open Source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) in the world. Snort IPS uses a series of
rules that help define malicious network activity and uses those rules to find packets that match against them
and generates alerts for users. Snort can be deployed inline to stop these packets, as well.

Scenario
-------------------
Static PCAP Analysis. Identify an attack by Analyzing packet captures with snort


Install (CentOS)
-------------------

	yum install -y wget gcc flex bison zlib libpcap pcre libdnet tcpdump epel-release
	yum install -y daq (should be in epel repo)

	wget https://www.snort.org/downloads/snort/snort-2.9.16.1-1.centos7.x86_64.rpm
	yum localinstall snort-2.9.16.1-1.centos8.x86_64.rpm

	snort --version

   *: You may see this Error
	snort: error while loading shared libraries: libdnet.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

	Fix:
	ln -s /usr/lib64/libdnet.so.1.0.1 /usr/lib64/libdnet.1

Basic Configuration
-------------------
  By default, Snort on CentOS expects to find a number of different rule files which are not included in the community rules.
  Comment out the unnecessary lines using the next command.

	cp /etc/snort/snort.conf /etc/snort/snort.conf.orig
	sed -i 's/include \$RULE\_PATH/#include \$RULE\_PATH/' /etc/snort/snort.conf

  Fix preprocessor rule path's

	sed -i 's/var WHITE_LIST_PATH ..\/rules/var WHITE_LIST_PATH .\/rules/' /etc/snort/snort.conf
	sed -i 's/var BLACK_LIST_PATH ..\/rules/var BLACK_LIST_PATH .\/rules/' /etc/snort/snort.conf

	touch /etc/snort/rules/white_list.rules
	touch /etc/snort/rules/black_list.rules

  Create missing path to dynamic rules libraries

	mkdir /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules

  Edit snort.conf, Scroll down to the section 6 and set the output for unified2 to
  log under filename of snort.log like below.

	# unified2
	# Recommended for most installs
	output unified2: filename snort.log, limit 128

  Validate default settings:

	snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

Rules Configuration
-----------------------
  Enable custom site rules in /etc/snort/snort.conf

	# site specific rules
	include $RULE_PATH/local.rules

	touch /etc/snort/rules/local.rules


  Registered user rules:
       Login/Create an account: https://www.snort.org/users/sign_in
       Latest snapshots are under Downloads after log in

       Download using Oinkcode (Oinkcode is under Profile -> Oinkcode)

		wget https://www.snort.org/rules/snortrules-snapshot-3000.tar.gz?oinkcode=XXXXXXXX -O registered.tar.gz
		tar -xvf registered.tar.gz -C /etc/snort

   Enbale ALL (Caution: some rule configurations may error and will need to be fixed)

	cp /etc/snort/snort.conf /etc/snort/snort.conf.backup
	cd /etc/snort/rules/
	echo "############## Registerd User Rules ################################" >> /etc/snort/snort.conf
	for r in `ls snort*.rules`; do echo "include \$RULE_PATH/$r" >> /etc/snort/snort.conf; done


Analyzing packet captures:
-----------------------------

		snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -A console -r traffic.pcap
