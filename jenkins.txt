Get Version:
----------------------------------------------------------
	To check the version of Jenkins, load the top page (or, as of 1.483, any .../api/* page too) and
	check for the X-Jenkins response header. This contains the version number of Jenkins, like "1.404" This
	is also a good way to check if an URL is a Jenkins URL.

		curl -sD /dev/stdout http://<host>/api/json | grep "X-Jenkins:\|X-Hudson:"

	CSRF Protection
	https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Remote+access+API
	Note: From Jenkins 2.96 onward, you can use an API token and avoid using a crumb / CSRF token.

	If your Jenkins uses the "Prevent Cross Site Request Forgery exploits" security option (which it should), when you
	make a POST request, you have to send a CSRF protection token as an HTTP request header.
	For curl/wget you can obtain the header needed in the request from the URL JENKINS_URL/crumbIssuer/api/xml (or .../api/json).
	Something like this:

	wget -q --auth-no-challenge --user USERNAME --password PASSWORD --output-document - \
		'JENKINS_URL/crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,":",//crumb)'

	This will print something like "Jenkins-Crumb:1234abcd", which you should add to the subsequent request.

----------------------------------------------------------

Jenkins listens on UDP port 33848. You can either send an UDP broadcast packet (targeted to 255.255.255.255) to this port, or you can send an
UDP multicast packet (targeted to 239.77.124.213) to this port. When a packet is received (the payload doesn't matter), Jenkins will send an XML
response to the sending UDP port as a datagram.

	* Send packet with Nmap - broadcast-jenkins-discover.nse

		nmap --script=broadcast-jenkins-discover --script-args=timeout=15s

Get a list of Installed plugins/versions:
----------------------------------------------------------

	curl -k 'https://<host>/pluginManager/api/json?depth=1' | jq -r '.plugins[] | "\(.shortName):\(.version)"'
